### Hi there, I'm Wolfgang

With an MSc in Motorsport Engineering and a BSc in Mechanical Engineering, I am passionate about simulation and performance engineering. I have a strong foundation in developing high-fidelity vehicle dynamics simulations and advanced control systems to optimize race car performance. This includes work in multi-body system dynamics, model predictive control, and applying a data-driven approach to engineering challenges.
